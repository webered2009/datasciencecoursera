This repository contains relevant R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project through Johns Hopkins and Coursera.

The data for this project come from `http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones`.

To run the code, the unaltered data must be present in the same folder.

`Codebook.md` provides an overview of the variables, data, and transformations used to clean up the data in the project.

`run_analysis.R` provides the code to perform the analyses for the five major components of the project. This file can be launched in RStudio with a simple file import.

The cleaned data file is titled `tidy.txt`.
